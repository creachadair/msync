// A Cond is an edge-triggered condition shared by multiple goroutines.  The
// [Cond.Ready] method returns a channel that is closed when the condition is
// activated.
//
// When a condition is first created it is inactive. It remains inactive until
// [Cond.Set] or [Cond.Signal] is called, either of which causes the current
// ready channel to be closed. Once a condition has been activated, it remains
// active until it is reset. Use [Cond.Reset] to make it inactive.
//
// The [Cond.Signal] method activates and then immediately resets the
// condition, acting as Set and Reset done in a single step.
//
// A zero Cond is ready for use, and is inactive, but must not be copied after
// any of its methods have been called.
